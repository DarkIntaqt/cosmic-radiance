Just another Riot Games API rate limiter with a cosmic glance âœ¨. 

## Features

- Automatic endpoint and platform detection
- Automatic rate limit discovery
- Customizable Timeout and good Retry-After handling
- GZIP handling to reduce traffic
- Prioritize requests with a `X-Priority: high` header
- Prometheus metrics to create dashboards about the rate limit status and queue sizes
- up to 99% close to uptime rate limits[^1]

###

## Getting started 

Click on the option that suits you best. For a normal production use-case, Docker is recommended.

### Docker

To get started with Docker, clone the project from GitHub.

```
git clone https://github.com/DarkIntaqt/cosmic-radiance.git
```

Next, you need to set a few environment variables. For that, you can copy the .env.example and adjust the settings to your needs.  
Finally, run the project in a docker container with: 

```
docker compose up -d
```

Then, you can start requesting `http://localhost:PORT/<platform>/<method>` or `http://<platform>.api.riotgames.com/<method> (with proxy-pass)`, based on your `MODE` (see configuration).

### Go (package)

To get started with using cosmic-radiance as a go package, install the package into your current workspace

```
go get github.com/DarkIntaqt/cosmic-radiance/ratelimiter
```

Next, you need to set a few environment variables. For that, you can copy the .env.example and adjust the settings to your needs.  

```go
package main

import (
   "github.com/DarkIntaqt/cosmic-radiance/ratelimiter"
)

func main() {
   port := 8080
   limiter := ratelimiter.Init(port)

   limiter.Start()

   // other logic
   limiter.Stop()
}
```

Then, you can start requesting `http://localhost:PORT/<platform>/<method>` or `http://<platform>.api.riotgames.com/<method> (with proxy-pass)`, based on your `MODE` (see configuration).

> [!WARNING]
> If you want to deploy cosmic-radiance to production, please use a [tagged version](https://github.com/DarkIntaqt/cosmic-radiance/releases), since development may take place in the main branch.

## Configuration

There are several .env variables which can fine tune cosmic-radiance. Some are required

| Name                 | Function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| API_KEY **required** | Your Riot Games API key. Cosmic-radiance needs your key to fire requests to the Riot Games API.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| PORT **required**    | Port on which the proxy is running. Chose a port that is free. Please double-check your port and Dockerfile configuration.                                                                                                                                                           |
| MODE **required**    | Either `PATH` or `PROXY`. In path mode, you request cosmic-radiance like a normal webserver with the endpoint following the endpoint. In the proxy mode, you can use proxy-pass to redirect <platform>.api.riotgames.com requests directly to cosmic-radiance. You need to use http. |
| TIMEOUT              | The wait time after which incoming requests are getting rejected. Time in seconds                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| PRIORITY_QUEUE_SIZE  | The size of the priority queue compared to the normal queue. In percent (%).                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| PROMETHEUS           | Either `ON` or `OFF`. Disabled by default. Enable to get prometheus statistics                                                                                                                                                                                                       |


## Error Codes

All error codes are returned as by the Riot Games API. There were a few additional error codes added. 

|  Code   | Where to be found | What does this mean                                              |
| :-----: | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **408** | Metrics           | The request timed out. Check the `Retry-After` header.           |
| **499** | Metrics           | The requesting client dropped the request.                       |
| **500** | Metrics and Proxy | The request to the Riot Games API failed before it was executed. |
